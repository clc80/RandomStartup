# RandomStartup

Coming up with new ideas for apps can be hard. This app will generate a new startup idea whenever the user taps the generate button or shakes the phone.
This app helped me to learn to...

* Create new Xcode projects
* Use different tools in Xcode
* Build simple user interfaces (UI) using Interface Builder
* Connect storyboard to code with the Identity Inspector, IBOutlets and IBActions
* Implement app logic for your Magic 8-Ball
